## Project description

This project was made with simple vanilla technologies (HTML 5, CSS3 and Js), without a framework, a JavaScript library called **AOS(Animate on scroll Library)** was used, to achieve a scroll effect every time this is done, the content appears with an animation. It goes to all public who want to hire me as a web developer. My goal was to test my skills and knowledge as a web developer, thus creating my own portfolio. Its functionality is easy, it is a functional and structured landing page.
